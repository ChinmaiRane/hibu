        <h1 class="display-4">BREEDS OF THE PANDA</h1>
        <p class="lead">The Panda has in total three species!</p>
        <hr class="my-4">
       <p>The panda, with its distinctive black and white coat, is adored by the world and considered a national treasure in China. This bear also has a special significance for WWF because it has been our logo since our founding in 1961.

Pandas live mainly in temperate forests high in the mountains of southwest China, where they subsist almost entirely on bamboo. They must eat around 26 to 84 pounds of it every day, depending on what part of the bamboo they are eating. They use their enlarged wrist bones that function as opposable thumbs.

A newborn panda is about the size of a stick of butter—about 1/900th the size of its mother—but females can grow up to about 200 pounds, while males can grow up to about 300 pounds as adults. These bears are excellent tree climbers despite their bulk.</p> 
<h4><b>+The following breeds can be seen,</b></h4>
<h5> The giant panda is a bear, and comes in two types: </h5>
<hr class="my-4">
<h6>1.a)THE REGULAR BLACK AND WHITE PANDA(Ailuropoda melanoleuca),</h6>
<img src="https://qphs.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-850e84f620ae2d4075fc625e1f0ae144.webp" style="width: 40%; margin-right: 30%;margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px;margin-left: 30%;" class="d-block "  alt="...">
<p>Giant pandas are bears that are native to China, where they are considered a national treasure. Despite their exalted status, giant panda (Ailuropoda melanoleuca) populations are vulnerable: fewer than 1,900 live in the wild, according to the Smithsonian National Zoo. About 300 live in zoos around the world.
</p>
<p>For many years, scientists wondered whether pandas were a type of bear, raccoon or something all their own. But plenty of genetic studies have made it clear that pandas are a type of bear, according to the San Diego Zoo.

    Also called great pandas, parti-colored bears, bamboo bears and white bears, giant pandas are distinguished from other pandas by their large size and black-and-white coloring. Their bold coloring provides camouflage — giant pandas are nearly invisible in dense patches of bamboo, according to the Smithsonian National Zoo.</p>
       <p>For the most part, giant pandas are loners. They dislike being around other pandas so much that they have a heightened sense of smell that lets them know when another panda is nearby so it can be avoided, according to the National Geographic. If they do come in contact with one another they'll growl, swat and bite each other until one gives up and leaves.

        On average, a giant panda's territory is about 1.9 square miles (5 square kilometers). To mark their territory, giant pandas secrete a waxy scent marker from a scent gland underneath their tail. Other giant pandas can likely tell the sex, age, reproductive condition, social status and more by sniffing the potent marker, according to the San Diego Zoo.</p>
        <hr class="my-4">
        <h6>1.b)THE SMALLER AND FAWN SUBSPECIES CALLED QINLING PANDA( Ailuropoda melanoleuca qinlingensis),</h6>
        <img src="https://qphs.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-4b61a173d01a9f0acf826c2dc46f519d" style="width: 40%; margin-right: 30%;margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px;margin-left: 30%;" class="d-block "  alt="...">
        <p>It differs from the more familiar nominate subspecies by its smaller skull and dark brown and light brown (rather than black and white) fur, and its smaller overall size.Its eye spots are under the lower lid, instead of around the eyes.
There are an estimated 200–300 Qinling pandas living in the wild.</p>

<p> On August 30, 1989, a female of this species was captured and brought to the Xi'an Zoo to be mated with a regular giant panda. This panda's offspring was black-and-white, but reportedly started becoming brownish as it aged. According to other reports she gave birth to three cubs, all of whom died shortly after being born. The mother, named Dan-Dan, died in 2000.
    
    Due to the Qinling subspecies being captive, it has been exposed to toxicants in their bamboo diet. Even though it is not fully known which toxicants it has been exposed to, it was determined to be heavy metals from atmospheric deposition. Thus, the conservation of the Qinling pandas may be compromised in the future due to air pollution in China.
    
    Dental health is important for the survival of the Qinling Pandas. These pandas have a survival rate of 5-20 years. The most common dental abnormalities that Qinling Pandas face are dental attrition and fractures. These two abnormalities can impact the survival rate of these pandas.</p>

      <h5>The Red Panda has two species,</h5>
      The red panda is an endangered mammal endemic to the Himalaya and Hengduan Mountains and is the only living member of the genus Ailurus and the family Ailuridae.
      <hr class="my-4">
     <h6>2)THE HIMALAYAN RED PANDA WITH LIGHT FUR COAT ON FACE(Ailurus Fulgens), </h6>
     <img src="https://qphs.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-5b3a6bfa4cd5fabce3009648b1a9bdfe" style="width: 40%; margin-right: 30%;margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px;margin-left: 30%;" class="d-block "  alt="...">
     <p>The Himalayan Red Panda is distributed in nepal,northern India, northern Myanmar, and Tibet and western Yunnan Province of China.It ahs experienced three bottlenecks and one very small expansion.*In 1825, Cuvier published the description, choosing the name Ailurus fulgens meaning "shining" or "fire-colored" cat</P>
        <p>The Himalayan Red Panda has less genetic diversity,higher linkage disequilibrium and higher genetic load,thus highlighting the urgency of protecting this endangered species.The red panda lives between 2,200 and 4,800 m (7,200 and 15,700 ft) altitude, inhabiting areas of moderate temperature between 10 and 25 °C (50 and 77 °F) with little annual change. It prefers mountainous mixed deciduous and conifer forests, especially with old trees and dense understories of bamboo</p>
        


     <hr class="my-4">
<h6>3)THE CHINESE RED PANDA WITH DARK FUR COAT ON FACE(Ailurus Styani),</h6>
<img src="https://qphs.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-a3ec1ae4a2c2769a9ac984b1b00068ae" style="width: 40%; margin-right: 30%;margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px;margin-left: 30%;" class="d-block "  alt="...">
<P>The Chinese  red panda is endemic to the temperate forests of the Himalayas, and ranges from the foothills of western Nepal to China in the east. Its easternmost limit is the Qinling Mountains of the Shaanxi Province in China.Temperate, sub-tropical forests of mixed deciduous-coniferous species: Abies, Tsunga, Aesculus, Juglans, Quercus and Acer.</P>

<p>In China – 3 provinces: 76,245 sq km potential habitat (25,668 sq km are protected in 46 reserves)Sichuan: 35,008 sq km (32 reserves = 16,121 sq km), 3,000 - 3,400 Red pandas,
    Yunnan: 21,658 sq km (8 reserves = 7,189 sq km), 1,600 - 2,000 Red pandas,
    Tibet: 9,500 sq km (6 reserves = 2,357 sq km), 1,400 - 1,600 Red pandas.Population in China is larger overall and has a slightly bigger skull – more robust teeth. Inflated frontal sinuses.
    Slight pelage differences.China population: Longer winter coat. Coat has more black. Tail stripes more distinct. </p>
