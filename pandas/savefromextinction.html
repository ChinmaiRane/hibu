        <h1 style="text-align: center;">Why are They Endangered? </h2>
        <h3 style="text-align: center;">Habitat loss and fragmentation </h3>
        <img src="https://wwfint.awsassets.panda.org/img/105681_2_351112.jpg" style="width: 20%; margin-right: 40%;margin-top: 20px;margin-left: 40%;" class="d-block "  alt="...">
        <figcaption style="text-align: center;margin-bottom: 15px;">Grazing cattle within a giant panda reserve. Wanglang Nature Reserve, Sichuan Province</figcaption>
        <p>After a significant increase in recent years, China now boasts a network of 67 panda reserves, which safeguard almost two-thirds of the giant pandas in the wild and just over half of their existing habitat.

            But habitat loss and fragmentation remain the gravest threats to the survival of the species.
            
            A large proportion of the panda's habitat has already been lost: logged for timber and fuel wood, or cleared for agriculture and infrastructure to meet the needs of the area's booming population.
            
            The Chinese government banned logging in the panda's habitat in 1998, but new roads and railways are continuing to cut through the region, further fragmenting the forests. This isolates panda populations and prevents them from breeding.</p>
            <h3 style="text-align: center;">Harvesting, hunting and tourism </h3>
            <img src="https://www.mdpi.com/animals/animals-08-00069/article_deploy/html/images/animals-08-00069-g003.png" style="width: 40%; margin-right: 30%;margin-top: 20px;margin-left: 30%;margin-bottom: 15px;" class="d-block "  alt="...">
            <p>The panda's mountainous forests continue to be degraded by people harvesting bamboo, gathering firewood and collecting medicinal herbs.

                The Minshan Mountains alone contain over 5,000 plant species: 75% of which are used in traditional Chinese medicine. Harvesting these medicinal plants provides many families with an important source of income. But it also places additional pressure on the fragile forests.
                
                As does mass tourism. The construction of tourist facilities and the rapidly increasing number of tourists in the forests is causing significant disturbance to pandas and their habitats.
                
                Some poaching of pandas still occurs. Hunting the animals for their fur has declined due to strict laws and greater public awareness of the panda’s protected status.</p>
                <hr class="my-4">
                <h1 style="text-align: center;">Why Save The Panda? </h2>
                    <img src="https://wwfint.awsassets.panda.org/img/pan_00718_1_509837.jpg" style="width: 20%; margin-right: 40%;margin-top: 20px;margin-left: 40%;margin-bottom: 15px;" class="d-block "  alt="...">   
               <p>We should do everything we can to save the giant panda because we are the ones that have driven it to the edge of extinction. And because we can.

                But pandas also play a crucial role in China's bamboo forests by spreading seeds and helping the vegetation to grow.
                
                So by saving pandas, we will also be saving so much more. We will be helping to protect not only these unique forests but also the wealth of species that live in them, such as dwarf blue sheep and beautiful multi-coloured pheasants.
                
                And we will be providing a lifeline for a host of other endangered animals, including the golden snub-nosed monkey, takin and crested ibis that share these magnificent forests with the panda.</p>
                
                <p>The panda’s habitat is also important for the livelihoods of local communities, who use it for food, income, fuel for cooking and heating, and medicine. And for people across the country.
                
                The panda's mountains form the watersheds for both the Yangtze and Yellow rivers, which are the economic heart of China – home to hundreds of millions of people. Economic benefits derived from these critical basins include tourism, subsistence fisheries and agriculture, transport, hydropower and water resources.
                
                So by protecting pandas, we’re helping to safeguard the broader environment, which so many people and animals depend on.
                
                Pandas themselves are also economically and culturally valuable. They are the national symbol of China and generate significant economic benefits for local communities through ecotourism and other activities.</p>

                   <p>When you donate to WWF, you will be donating to panda conservation projects on the ground in China. Your donation will contribute towards a variety of initiatives, including:</p> 
                   <p> <b>Nature reserve protection </b>to ensure that the reserve borders are patrolled and no illegal hunting or logging takes place inside them</p>
                    <p><b>Community development projects</b> such as providing wood saving stoves to limit the impact of wood-fuel harvesting on the panda's forests.</p>
                   <p><b> Research and monitoring work</b>, such as setting up infrared cameras to record panda movements in the Minshan and Qinling Mountains.</p>
                   <h4  style="text-align: center;"> Travel smart</h4>
                  <p> Panda tourism is on the rise. The Chinese government and WWF are now working on ways to reduce the impact of tourism on panda habitats, by promoting eco-tourism.</p>
